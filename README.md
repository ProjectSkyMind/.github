# 🛰️ SwarmNet-Labs

Welcome to **SwarmNet-Labs** — a research-first organization building cutting-edge software infrastructure for drone swarm intelligence, surveillance, and autonomous coordination.

> **Zero Hardware. 100% Simulation. Full Tactical Swagger.**

## 🎯 Mission

To create a modular, scalable, and AI-driven drone swarm system with a fully virtual development pipeline — simulating everything from swarm coordination and video analytics to secure comms and battlefield dashboards.

This org exists to:

- Research autonomous drone swarms without needing physical drones.
- Build a robust simulator-based development and testing environment.
- Open-source critical modules to empower civilian safety and crisis response.
